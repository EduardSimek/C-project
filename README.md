# C-project
This application is focused to the theoretical analysis of image processing algorithms and to comparison of the processing time of the identical functions of the C# libraries - EmguCV and the AForge.NET. The main goal of the project was to measure a set of 10 processing times of the same image using the libraries EmguCV and AForge.NET and evaluation in the form of a graph.
